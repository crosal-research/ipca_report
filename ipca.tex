\textbf{Comments}: Below consensus headline, low core figures, and low
diffusion depicts a positive picture, thus underscoring the strong ongoing
deflating forces. Main drivers in the month \emph{vis Ã  vis} our take
were: 1) yet again, low inflation of food at home, which fell
0.95\%mom, 2) gasoline prices, which declined 2.98\%mom, and 3) apparel
-0.11\%. Perhaps, the only drawback was the (limited) surge of core
service inflation; however, still standing at low level for historical
standards. Going forward, we believe these figures set a downward byes
to our July CPI's forecasts, currently at 0.13\%mom, which adds to the
ever more recurrent downward changes to gasoline prices.
