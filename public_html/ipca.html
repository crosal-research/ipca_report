Dear All, <br>

<ul>
<li>Mid-term CPI came in at -0.18%mom, well below Bbg's consensus of -0.10%mom, and below our forecast -0.09%mom.</li>
<li>Diffusion reached 45%, falling 8bps on monthly basis, the lowest since 2012.</li>
<li>Underlying services came at 0.38%, 11pbs higher. However, all other core measures retrenched on a monthly basis.</li>

<b>Comments</b>: Below consensus headline, low core figures, and low
diffusion depicts a positive picture, thus underscoring the strong ongoing
deflating forces. Main drivers in the month <i>vis Ã  vis</i> our take
were: 1) yet again, low inflation of food at home, which fell
0.95%mom, 2) gasoline prices, which declined 2.98%mom, and 3) apparel
-0.11%. Perhaps, the only drawback was the (limited) surge of core
service inflation; however, still standing at low level for historical
standards. Going forward, we believe these figures set a downward byes
to our July CPI's forecasts, currently at 0.13%mom, which adds to the
ever more recurrent downward changes to gasoline prices.
