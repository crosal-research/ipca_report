<h2 id="orgaa14255"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Scenario Assessment</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
The political crisis blew off at worst possible juncture. Clearly, the
momentum was building around a possible approval of the pension system
reform, and confidence over the economy was accordingly
growing. Unfortunately, however, none of these can be taken for
granted any longer, since now the fate of the reform is all but clear,
and the economy looks set to be hampered by the political uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, soon after the crisis was triggered, we lowered
our GDP forecast for 2017E to 0.1% from 0.5%, while we are now
advancing the 207E year-end Fx rate to hover about R$|US$3.40, as
opposed to our previous forecast of R$|US$3.20. Moreover, we had
revised marginally up our CPI inflation forecast to 4.1% from 3.9%,
just to lower it back shortly after to 3.8% due to the recent downward
adjustment of gasoline and energy prices. Finally, in light the of the
Brazilian Central Bank's (BCB) recent communication we are revising
our 2017E year-end Selic rate to 9.0%, implying cuts of 75pbs and
50bps in the next two meetings, and full stop.

<p>
Granted, any scenario revision at moment ought to be taken with a huge
grain of salt. In the particular case of monetary policy, we
acknowledge that uncertainties around our new call may be tilted to
the downside, but, on the upside, there is an important tail risk that
cannot be dismissed. In other words, on the one hand, we reckon
deflating forces remain pervasive, but, on the other one, existing
uncertainties over the fiscal policy long-term outlook call for a
premium. Therefore, the fate of the pension reform will be key to
determine which of these forces should prevail down the line, and
whether our new call will prove to be too conservative or not.
</p>

<p>
On the global front, the outlook persists favorable towards the
country. The end of Trump's rally has led US long-term rates to new
lows, while Brazil terms of trade have remained high for historical
standards. Finally, the confirmation of Macron's victory in France's
presidential election has forestalled the growth of populism in
developed economies, at least for now, and shattered fears over EU
disintegration.
</p>

<p>
In short, Brazil is certainly to blame for its own mess and, as such,
ought to find an escape route from its ailments. In this respect, our
working hypothesis is that the end the political stalemate shouldn't
happen overnight, but Temer's economic team should largely remain in
place along the way. As for reforms, we consider that the labor reform
may be approved still in 1H2017 as is, while the outlook for the
pension reform seems much less clear cut.
</p>

<p>
In any case, we are not very hopeful the outcome of the trial on
Dilma/Temer's campaign funding will be any silver bullet in terms of
stirring a rapid resolution of the political crisis. Whatever way it
goes, we are likely to witness a legal row that should only gradually
lead to a more politically stable scenario, meaning, that it is likely
to take months until we get there.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<blockquote>
<p>
The end of Trump's rally and Macron's election were the main recent events.  The
global economy continues to show signs of concerted growth, favoring
cyclical activities. Low rates and low risk premium continue to prevail.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The US growth outlook persists largely intact. The economy is close
to full employment and standing roughly at about its potential, which
is, as it widely acknowledge by now, below its historical
levels. Meanwhile, risk aversion remains puzzling low, close to its
historical low, despite the increasing political noise coming from
within.
</p>

<p>
On the momentary policy, there has been little changes since last
month. Signals have reinforced the thesis that Mr. Tump's fiscal
agenda will need to be revised down for political reasons, while Fed's
strategy to shrink its balance sheet remains to be seen. Consequently,
our bet that the Fed should hike its baseline rate for another couple
of 25bps this year remains on the money, in <i>tandem</i> with the decline
in long rates after the lukewarm jobs report of May.
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere in the EU, Macron's victory in France's Presidential
election has eased fears of growing populism in developed markets,
which, in particular, could lead to further fragmentation of the
EU. Now, the next stop will be German's general elections scheduled to
September 24th, but risks over there look less extreme.
</p>

<p>
Overall, global growth remains on the positive camp. Similarly to the
previous month, cyclicals are expanding above 2016's trend, led by
emerging Asia, thus favoring global trade. In addition, in real terms,
the yuan is clearly overvalued <i>vis Ã  vis</i> the 2015-2016 years, which
has contributed to tame some of the protectionist rhetoric in the US.
</p>

<p>
In face of this benign global backdrop, the main fear on our radar
screen is the political risk in US combined with extremely low risk
aversion. Taken together, they raise worries of possible tail
events, should the market decide to turn sour because of the any
meaningful political setbacks in the US.

<blockquote>
<p>
The political bombshell of three weeks ago has set the country on
bumpy road, with consequences to monetary policy and the economy at
large.  Long-term fiscal outlook is again on the radar screen.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
1Q20107E GDP growth of 1.0%qoqsa has been welcomed, but failed to
change our vision for the medium-term.  This is because growth has
been driven primarily by the agriculture sector, which is unlikely to
prevail going forward. Also, as we have guessed, the surge in
industrial activity in January and February were largely boosted by
statistical artifacts and so short-lived. Hence, more likely than not,
we should witness yet another quarter of subdued economic performance
in 2Q2017, probably, on the negative camp.
</p>

<p>
In fact, we are wary of the nasty relationship between growth and
volatility, which historically hasn't gone down too well. The channels
through which this dynamics plays out are many-fold, in particular,
via confidence but also through the financial markets. In this
respect, one can see that already playing out through interest rates,
with the cost of money standing already few notches higher and after
volatility having reached unprecedented levels (see exhibit \ref{fig:cdi10})
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, the external sector's conditions are quite
favorable. Trade balance in March reached at 2.7% of GDP on the 12
months rolling basis, while terms of trade are above historical
standards, as in exhibit \ref{fig:tt}. Therefore, the combination of lower
global long-term rates, constructive global growth, and sounding
external accounts have managed to curb the depreciation of the local
currency, despite the surge in sovereign risk spreads since the crisis
was triggered.

<h3 id="orgd0621bf"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Fiscal policy and Politics: risks to fiscal consolidation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Soon after the market gave Brazil the benefit of the doubt in 2Q2016,
the BRL strengthened, inflation came down and, in due time, the
Brazilian Central Bank (BCB) started to lower rates. Behind it all,
there was a new political coalition supporting a long-term fiscal
adjustment based on public spending cap and, potentially, the pension
system reform as its ultimate pillar. As it so happened, real interest
rates came down, triggering a whole positive dynamics, in particular,
lowering public debt service costs (see exhibit \ref{fig:cost}), in a
classic case of the so-called expansionary-contraction.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the spurn of the ongoing crisis have shaken the pillars
of this new coalition, and, accordingly, has raised questions over
this forward looking-based fiscal adjustment. In fact, we reckon this
type of concern is not groundless, as recent events have suggested.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of example, on May 31 the Lower House approved a 15 years
phase-out plan to end a network of State level subsidies. This sounded
all well, were it not for government having conceded on key points,
and thus seriously undermining the very credibility of the bill.
</p>

<p>
More specifically, while the original bill stated the subsidies would
gradually wane over the years, now sizable chunk will remain as is
till the end of the period. Therefore, the deal stoke by the
government and congress have reduced part of the savings along the
way, while making a sudden drop in the subsidies at the end of the 15
years period not very credibility.
</p>

<p>
A similar signal can be read from the recent re-shuffle of the BNDES'
CEO. Although we yet don't know whether the existing policy to curb
subsidized credit and focus primarily on project with social
spillovers will be maintained, the management change does raise
questions in this respect. After all, changes on this front could have
a meaningful impact on monetary policy, since the latter has been able
to take a more prominent role in reviving the economy, among other
things, because of the shrinkage of earmarked credit.
</p>

<p>
In sum, the long-term type of fiscal adjustment is under suspicious,
and should the government not reorganize its coalition soon, there are
risks the pension system reform may be watered down, and the long-term
debt-to-GDP dynamics may lose a key credibility anchor and be yet
again under doubts.
