*Comments*: Below consensus headline, low core figures, and low
diffusion depicts a positive picture, thus underscoring the strong ongoing
deflating forces. Main drivers in the month /vis Ã  vis/ our take
were: 1) yet again, low inflation of food at home, which fell
0.95%mom, 2) gasoline prices, which declined 2.98%mom, and 3) apparel
-0.11%. Perhaps, the only drawback was the (limited) surge of core
service inflation; however, still standing at low level for historical
standards. Going forward, we believe these figures set a downward byes
to our July CPI's forecasts, currently at 0.13%mom, which adds to the
ever more recurrent downward changes to gasoline prices.
