Amid this local Background, the global outlook persists on a positive
mode. Europe - believe it or not, has turned into to being the new
darling of the market, as it is growing at a consistent and robust
pace. In fact, the market is already eyeing the ECB's unwinding of its
QE and some monetary tightening down the line, something unheard of at
the turn of the year.

As for the US, the latest numbers have been a bit on the soft
side. Despite that, the long-term treasury has gone up in last couple
of weeks, while the VIX has persisted stubbornly close to its
historical lows. Meanwhile, the Fed has raised its baseline rate by
25pbs, as largely anticipated by the market, while also laying out its
plan to shrink its balance sheet effective immediately. The market
wasn't bothered too much about it all.

In sum, the major mature economies are growing at consistent pace, so
much so that Central Bank's therein are gradually shifting
gears. Despite that, the market seems reassured by the idea that
monetary tightening ought to be gradual, since lower productivity
growth should continue to keep long-term rates at low levels by
historical standards. This outlook persisting, it should help the
country to navigate these trouble waters.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
US and EU are facing similar challenges: economic expansion at full
potential and stubbornly low inflation. Monetary policy is certainly
in order, but pace should remain mild.
#+END_QUOTE

The US activity figures came in a bit on the soft side as of late.
However, the view that it is operating at full potential remain
intact. In fact, despite the weak batch of data, the yield of ten
years Treasury has gone up and is back gain above the
2.30%. Meanwhile, volatility has remained at close to historical lows.

On the momentary policy, the Fed decided to raise the Fed Funds by
25bps to xx, as largely anticipated by the market. More importantly
perhaps, it has disclosed its plan to unwind its balance. In a
nutshell, should market conditions allows, it will gradually increase
its amortization payment it receives, net of rollovers, from
Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities up to a monthly of USR50bn
in 12 months time. Following this policy, it expects to lower the
excess reserves liability its holding, albeit at levels about crisis
one.

Across the Atlantic, the EU continues to show signs of growth
resilience, by and large as product of the ECB QE. As matter of fact,
growth has been widespread,...

Similar to the Fed, the ECB is facing the puzzle of facing an economy
expanding at its full potential, and, at the observing inflation
stubbornly. Hypotheses abound, however, none of these Central Banks
seem to have a clear answer as of when this divergence is like to
disappear.

In face of this benign global backdrop, the main fear on our radar
screen is the political risk in US combined with extremely low risk
aversion. Taken together, they raise worries of possible tail
events, should the market decide to turn sour because of the any
meaningful political setbacks in the US.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In short-term, the crisis is likely to have augmented deflating
drivers. However, amid political paralysis and and waning reform hopes,
this should provide little extra leeway to monetary policy.
#+END_QUOTE

The latest patch of data wasn't bad. By and large activity numbers' of
April were pointing northward and, as underscored by the Central
Bank's Ibc-br, overall activity expanded in the month. Moreover,
industrial production of May has inaugurated the month expanding yxy%.

In the meantime, inflation in May yet again came in quite low by
historical measures, regardless of energy related one-timers. However,
the main question persists: How much is the economic crisis likely to
nhave deffer the economic recovery?

Based on confidence gauges, the crisis is already abating activity,
something that should become more clear as June's data start to come
out. Importantly, once this weakness is confirmed, it is undoubted
that deflating forces will persist longer, provided everything else is
the same.

As matter of fact, the Central Bank itself has acknowledged that the
ongoing crisis may have a deflationary impact, although warning the
risks over the neutral interest rate. Therefore, the net impact on
interest rates is left to be since.

Ourselves, we believe that everything else the same, the Selic rate
should reach 8.00% by year-end, where it should stand for the whole
2018E. Cutting a long story short, the crisis has hindered the neutral
rate, as thus entailing large rates by the end of the cycle. However,
the fiscal risks implies that upside risk to this call should not be
dismissed.
